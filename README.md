a. What is amqp?
AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open-standard messaging protocol that enables secure, reliable, and efficient communication between distributed systems through a message broker. It supports features like message queuing, routing, acknowledgments, and transactions, making it ideal for decoupled and scalable architectures. AMQP is language- and platform-agnostic, allowing seamless integration across different technologies, and is widely implemented in brokers such as RabbitMQ, Apache Qpid, and Azure Service Bus for use cases like task queues, event-driven systems, and microservices communication. Its structured model (exchanges, queues, bindings) provides flexibility in message delivery patterns (pub/sub, point-to-point, RPC).

b. What does it mean? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first guest, and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for?
The connection string "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672" specifies an AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) connection to a RabbitMQ server where the first guest is the default username, the second guest is the default password (both commonly used in development), localhost indicates the broker is running on the local machine, and 5672 is the default AMQP port for messaging; this setup is typical for local development but should be replaced with secure credentials and a proper host in production environments.

# Reflection and Running at least three subscribers
By running five subscriber consoles concurrently, RabbitMQ was able to distribute the workload more efficiently. This is reflected in the message rate chart, where we observe a short spike in delivery and acknowledgement, followed by an immediate drop in the queue size. Since the subscribers consume messages almost simultaneously, queued messages do not accumulate for long. This demonstrates how scaling the number of consumers helps handle incoming message bursts quickly, minimizing delay and ensuring responsiveness even under load.
